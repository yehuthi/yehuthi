<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
${r(new Date("2024-11-12T01:54:39.000Z"))} I began working on
a Victoria 3 mod that adds modern Middle-Eastern countries to the game map.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to allow nationals of modern Middle-Eastern countries (that are
not Egypt or Turkey) to be able to play as their country, with
<em>some</em> consideration for the 19th century historic context that
takes place in the game. Additionally, to give such players their modern
neighbors, so they don't compete with massive (and potentially
bloodlustful) Ottoman and Egyptian neighbors.
</p>
<p>
The history that this mod does somewhat seek to emulate is around the 1930s
and the 1940s, reflected in Israel's and Lebanon's religious and ethnic
demographics.
