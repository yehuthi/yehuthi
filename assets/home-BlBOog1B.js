<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
I'm a self-taught software developer. I do various kinds of programming; I
have a rich history of functional programming, I specialize in low-level
programming the most, and I have a great interest in high-performance
software.

<p>
In this (WIP) site, you could find some of my projects, utilities,
resources, and thoughts.
